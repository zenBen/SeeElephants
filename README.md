# SeeElephants

## Preamble
The title _SeeElephants_ refers, on the one hand, to the roundworm _C. Elegans_, whose connectome has been fully mapped for some time [1]. On the other hand, it is a reference to the parable of the wise blind men and the elephant, a commonly-used metaphor when describing humankind's investigations of our own brain and mind. The implication of both references is that we can gather many facts and yet remain blind, and yet the hope is always there that we may one day '**see the elephant**'.

I hope this explanation meets the requirement for being creative!

## What I would like to learn

I'm here to advance my line of research on the neural correlates of high performance cognition. Although brain networks themselves are not my focus, they are part of the necessary empirical basis for interpreting observations, which I aim to make in multimodal data: behaviour, EEG/MEG (as I require high temporal resolution), physiology, phenomenology.

Looking at the reading list, Table 1 (ranked according to my personal preference), I see that most papers seem to deal with (f)MRI data. This is fine since I need to learn basics, but I hope to also learn about what I can do with encephalography-type data.

## What I would like to do

I would like to learn practical methods for working in source space in M/EEG, using tools suited to my background (Computer Science) and skills, e.g. Matlab, R, or Python.
