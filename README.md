# SeeElephants

The title refers, on the one hand, to the roundworm _C. Elegans_, whose connectome has been fully mapped for some time (REF). On the other hand, it is a reference to the parable of the wise blind men and the elephant, a commonly-used metaphor when describing humankind's investigations of our own brain and mind. The implication of both references is that we can gather many facts and yet remain blind, and yet the hope is always there that we may one day '**see the elephant**'. This, I believe, meets the requirement for being creative.
